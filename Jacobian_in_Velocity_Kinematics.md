# Jacobian in Velocity Kinematics

The relationship between velocity and joint velocity $\dot{q}(t)=(q_{1}, q_{2}, ..., q_{n})^{T}$ is given by:

$$\begin{bmatrix}v_{n}^{0} \\\ \omega_{n}^{0} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}J_{v} \\\ J_{\omega} \end{bmatrix}\dot{q}$$

Jacobian matrix usually gives the format
Basically, there are two ways for the derivation of Jacobian matrix.
