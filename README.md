## Very Important Note

**If you would like to see all formulas in all .md file, please add the MathJax Plugin. The steps to add the plugin is search the [Chrome app store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions) and type 'mathjax' in the 'search' section. Then add MathJax Plugin for Github**

## Installation

One should download the [robotics toolbox](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-matlab) and install it according to the steps. Then one needs to set the path in matlab file 'pathdef.m' so that the robotics toolbox can be loaded into matlab.
