# Differential Kinematic Control Equations for Manipulators

In this section, we will discuss a general method for obtaining the Jacobian with differential change in position and orientation as dependent variables and differential change in joint variables as independent variables.

## Coordinate Frame attached to the end-effector

For arm-type robots, the axis of the tool/end-effector is associated with the $z$-axis by convention and is called the approach vector and denoted **$\hat{a}$**=($a_{x}, a_{y}, a_{z}$)
